# Image Generation Models With A Focus on Diffusion Models
This repository contains the implementation of various generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM).
The project is part of a Bachelor's thesis focused on image generation, with a particular emphasis on diffusion-based models and their applications.
